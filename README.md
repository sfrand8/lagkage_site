### Lagkage

I wanted to get back into C#, so this project is simply a playground for me to try out different things that I remember doing when I wrote C#, and then also investigating new ways of doing it as .Net and the landscape around it has evolved.

The functionalities might be developed multiple times and is simply done for me to try doing the same things in different ways to experiment with different packages and concepts.
e.g. Controller based Web API and Minimal APIs, or Swagger UI and Scalar UI for OpenAPI.


### Why Lagkager?

My wife has a book where she can flip pages in layers for Fl√∏deboller, and then mix different types of filling or bottom layer etc. and I thought it could be fun to build an interactive site that could do the same but for layered cakes instead.
My goal is to eventually build a front-end for it as well, but I haven't done much front-end in my time so it will probably be a while, and besides the project started as a way of getting back into C#.
