### Lagkage

I wanted to get back into C#, so this project is simply a playground for me to try out different things that I remember doing when I wrote C#, and then also investigating new ways of doing it as .Net and the landscape around it has evolved.

The functionalities might be developed multiple times and is simply done for me to try doing the same things in different ways to experiment with different packages and concepts.
e.g. Controller based Web API and Minimal APIs, or Swagger UI and Scalar UI for OpenAPI.
